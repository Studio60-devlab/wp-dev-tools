Some pieces of code we use for wordpress development

In the process of web design itself, we need to develop the style first, and then integrate in WP.

We set the less variables to process a file called "custom.css" (for custom.scss or .sass) 

We create a specific directory for those, in our theme, called assets.
those files are registered in /functions/front.php (frontend).


clean-ds_store.sh -> it cleans the .DS_Store metadata folders.
  i need this stuff before commit. I will add soon a vscode option too ;)
  
ACF files -> basic and common fields for a website - still in progress
   maybe more relevant in json
